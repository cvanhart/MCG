        <h1>About MCG</h1>
        <p>MCG (Michigan Consulting Group) is a student-led, pro bono consulting organization. Our mission is two-fold: deliver meaningful value to community partners and help undergraduates build real consulting, technical, and professional skills through hands-on projects.</p>

          <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
          <p>We combine structured training with real client work. New members complete a skills bootcamp covering research, problem structuring, slide design, analytics, and communication. Then, students apply this toolkit on client engagements with mentorship from experienced leads.</p>
